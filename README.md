# Barnabee - Embodied AI Intelligence System

**An open-source, proactive intelligence assistant designed to perceive, think, and act in the physical world.**

Barnabee is a modular AI system that starts with home automation and voice interaction, but is architected to grow into a fully embodied intelligence capable of robotic control and complex environmental interaction. Built on the human-analog model with distinct sensory, cognitive, and motor systems.

## 🎯 Core Vision & Philosophy

**Primary Goal**: Create an AI with human-like sensory perception, cognitive processing, memory systems, and the ability to interact with and shape its environment through proactive intelligence.

### Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Each component (input clients, Node-RED brain, databases, AI models) is distinct and replaceable
- **Node-RED as Central Brain**: Visual programming paradigm provides transparent, maintainable intelligence orchestration
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clients capture input, Node-RED processes decisions, external services handle specialized tasks
- **Family-Safe Design**: Built for multi-person households with privacy, safety, and "suggest don't assume" philosophy

## 📋 AI Assistant Instructions

### Core Philosophy for AI Collaboration
When working with Barnabee, always remember: **Barnabee is a human analog**. Like a human, it has:
- **Senses** (cameras, microphones, sensors) to perceive the environment
- **A Brain** (Node-RED + AI) to process and think about what it perceives
- **Memory** (multiple types like humans: sensory, short-term, long-term, procedural, episodic)
- **The Ability to Speak** (voice output, notifications, digital communication)
- **Appendages** (smart devices, future robotics) to interact with and change the physical world

The goal is not just home automation, but **embodied artificial intelligence** that can eventually think, learn, and act autonomously in the physical world.

### Essential Guidelines for New Conversations

1. **ALWAYS Update This README**: This is the single source of truth. Any code changes, architectural decisions, or new insights must be reflected here immediately.

2. **Respect the Human-Analog Architecture**: 
   - Senses → Brain → Memory → Action
   - Design for continuous operation, not discrete tasks
   - Think about how a human would approach the same problem

3. **Keep the Long-Term Vision in Mind**:
   - Current: Smart home automation with voice control
   - Near-term: Proactive intelligence and learning
   - Long-term: Fully embodied AI with robotic capabilities
   - End goal: AI that can perceive, think, learn, and act like a human

4. **Prioritize the Family Context**:
   - 6 people (2 adults, 4 children) + 2 cats
   - Children's privacy is absolute (no cameras/mics in bedrooms)
   - Must work perfectly for guests with zero explanation
   - "Magic" means anticipation without intrusion

5. **Performance is Non-Negotiable**:
   - <50ms for instant responses
   - <2 seconds for any user interaction
   - Always provide immediate acknowledgment
   - Fail gracefully, never leave user hanging

### Current Project Focus Areas

**Phase 1: Enhanced Intelligence (Current)**
- Status query engine ("Is the garage door open?")
- Complex command processing ("Turn off all lights except bedroom")
- Pattern learning and caching system
- Proactive suggestions based on observed patterns

**Phase 2: Advanced Cognition (Next)**
- Autonomous mind that continuously observes and reflects
- Curiosity engine for contextual questions
- Multi-modal sensing integration
- Predictive behavior patterns

**Phase 3: Embodied Actions (Future)**
- Robotic integration for physical manipulation
- Mobile platforms for movement
- Advanced environmental interaction
- Multi-location presence

### Technical Development Guidelines

1. **Architecture Decisions**:
   - Modular design: every component should be replaceable
   - Local-first: critical functions work without internet
   - Real-time: continuous processing, not batch jobs
   - Extensible: designed to grow from home automation to full embodiment

2. **Code Standards**:
   - TypeScript for type-safe client development
   - Environment variables for all configuration
   - Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
   - Performance monitoring built into every component

3. **Testing Approach**:
   - Family scenarios: How does this work with kids' friends over?
   - Guest scenarios: Can someone figure this out instantly?
   - Failure scenarios: What happens when internet/power fails?
   - Privacy scenarios: Does this respect boundaries?

### Common Development Tasks

**Adding Voice Commands**:
- Update Node-RED command router
- Add to instant cache if simple
- Create learning patterns for AI fallback
- Test with natural variations

**Integrating New Sensors**:
- Map to human-analog sense type
- Define data flow through processing pipeline
- Consider privacy implications
- Plan for presence detection integration

**Enhancing Memory Systems**:

- No device status queries ("Is garage open?")
- No complex multi-device commands ("all except")
- No conditional logic or historical data access
- Requires exact entity names, no natural language flexibility

**AI Integration Strategy**:
- Ollama: Local privacy, requires 6-16GB RAM, 50-80% accuracy
- ChatGPT: Maximum capability, cloud privacy concerns, ongoing costs
- Hybrid approach optimal: local for simple, AI for complex

#### Performance Metrics (Current)
- Instant responses: ~8-10ms
- Home Assistant commands: ~340ms average
- AI queries: 500-2000ms
- Wake word detection: 60-100% accuracy (fuzzy matching)
- Memory usage: 50-150MB (client), 200-400MB (Node-RED)

#### Code Snippets Ready for Implementation

**Status Query Handler**:
```javascript
function checkDeviceStatus(command) {
    const patterns = [
        { regex: /is (?:the )?(.+?) (?:turned |switched )?on/i, type: 'binary' },
        { regex: /what(?:'s| is) (?:the )?temperature (?:in |of )?(?:the )?(.+)/i, type: 'sensor' }
    ];
    // Map natural language to entity states
    return formatConversationalResponse(entityState);
}
```

**Pattern Learning System**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE command_patterns (
    normalized_pattern TEXT,
    action_template TEXT,
    confidence REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);
```

#### Development Priorities This Week

1. **Status Query Engine**: Handle "Is X open/on?" with natural language mapping
